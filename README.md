builder-core
============

Read/Write implementations for Cap'n Proto's built-in types (see [the
specification](https://capnproto.org/language.html#built-in-types) for a
full listing).
The `Orphan` class, `ArenaB` type specification, and more also appear here,
making `builder-core` a bit of a blob.
